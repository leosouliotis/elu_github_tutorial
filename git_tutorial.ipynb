Each object can thereafter be modified separately and in parallel so that the objects become different. In this context the objects are called *branches*. The users of the version control system can branch any branch."

    "\n",

    "- You modify files in your working tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area.\n",
